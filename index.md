## about – profile and competencies summary

Mostly and preferably in telco domain, focusing on data-intensive back-end applications. \
Implementing analytical transformations (i.e. deriving data from relationships among data), also in bulk and continuous processing. \
Long-term commitment to constructing durable non-throw-away software. \
Oriented towards projects rather than school-like one-day tasks.

While experienced, I am no rentier and my goal is not to endlessly repeat what I already know, neither do I think that cutting and pasting is the best way to employ skilled people. \
On the contrary there is a capacity for evolving, using what we know, to do what we do not know yet. \
I am driven by my interest in the subject matter and in new things, while always keeping in mind the usefulness for others (it is a job).

This is shown by a sequence of long term cycles (details are on the [next page](./competencies.md)):

* current cycle: Scala/FP, Big Data processing (Spark, Kafka), SQL
* previous cycle: Oracle database development and performance tuning
* hystorical (but qualifying), archived cycle: C++

All that was made possible also by my background education (details are [here](./education.md)):

* Master’s Degree in Mathematics

---
Problem- and concept- and question- driven, self-learner, self-starter and self-motivating. \
Appreciating complexity, differencies, and diversity, both in things and in people. \
Deductive, rather than repetitive. Fundamentally capable of approaching new (unseen) things. \
Evolutionary, both on projects and myself. Valuing changes, marking passages. \
Team player, collaborative person (rather than competitive), constructive, willing to share knowledge with receptive people.
