## competencies details

* *current*
    + Snowflake
        - administration for account-level objects (databases and schemas, warehouses, roles, users, grants, storage integrations)
        - development of analytical data transformations, using SQL and Snowflake Scripting
        - ingestion and mapping of semi-structured (e.g., Parquet, JSON) data
        - incremental processing using Snowflake Streams
        - development of generic procedures, using dynamic SQL and metadata
        - native logging with event table
        - troubleshooting, tuning, and cost monitoring
        - database change management using OpenTofu (open-source Terraform alternative) with Snowflake provider for account-level objects
        - database change management using schemachange for schema-level objects

    + Big Data processing
        - Spark: SQL and DataFrame API
        - Spark: DeltaLake library
        - Kafka
        - Big Data file formats (e.g., Parquet), and table formats (e.g., Delta Lake)
        - Cloud Storage (Azure Blob Storage, AWS S3)

   + Scala/FP
        - Functional Programming paradigm
        - Odersky courses progfun1 and progfun2 (including all assignments) passed (it is a course, not a TV series!)
        - core language, sbt, Standard Library
        - Additional libraries: ZIO and its ecosystem (including zio-kafka and zio-test), circe, doobie, FastParse, etc.
        - this language has been my access path to the Java ecosystem and to several Big Data platforms: Kafka, Spark, etc.

* *all-encompassing (forever)*
    + UNIX and Linux
        - several flavours (from HP-UX/Solaris/AIX to Linux to WSL2)
        - both as a development platform and an operating environment
        - including modern tools, e.g., git, Docker

* *previous*
    + Oracle Database development
        - Analytic SQL: window functions, pivot/unpivot, model clause, SQL row pattern matching (12c)
        - serious SQL tuning (no quackery): interpreting and altering execution plans (e.g., with hints)
        - performance concepts and measures: time (elapsed, db, cpu) and resources (I/O, memory, ...)
        - methodical (using measures and statistics) database/application performance diagnostics and troubleshooting
        - performance diagnostic reports: AWR, ASH, Real Time SQL Monitoring

---
* *hystorical, archived*
    + C++ and Standard C++ Library
        - object-oriented and generic (i.e. based on type parametrization) paradigms
        - STL (Standard Template Library)

    + R and ggplot2 for data visualization

    + Python and Seaborn for data visualization
